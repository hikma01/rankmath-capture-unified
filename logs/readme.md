# RMCU Logs Directory

This directory contains log files generated by the RankMath Capture Unified plugin.

## Log Files Structure

- **rmcu-debug.log** - Debug information and detailed execution traces
- **rmcu-error.log** - Error messages and exceptions
- **rmcu-capture.log** - Capture events and processing logs
- **rmcu-webhook.log** - n8n webhook communication logs
- **rmcu-api.log** - API requests and responses
- **rmcu-performance.log** - Performance metrics and timing data

## Log Rotation

Logs are automatically rotated when they reach 10MB or after 30 days.
Old logs are archived with a timestamp suffix (e.g., `rmcu-debug-2024-01-15.log`)

## Security

⚠️ **This directory is protected by .htaccess**
- Direct access to log files is blocked
- Directory listing is disabled
- Only the plugin can read/write these files

## Log Levels

1. **DEBUG** - Detailed debug information
2. **INFO** - Informational messages
3. **NOTICE** - Normal but significant events
4. **WARNING** - Warning messages
5. **ERROR** - Error messages
6. **CRITICAL** - Critical issues requiring immediate attention
7. **ALERT** - Action must be taken immediately
8. **EMERGENCY** - System is unusable

## Reading Logs

Logs can be viewed from:
- WordPress Admin: **RM Capture → Logs**
- WP-CLI: `wp rmcu logs view --type=error --lines=50`
- Direct file access (server only)

## Configuration

Log settings can be configured in WordPress Admin:
- **RM Capture → Settings → Advanced → Logging**

Options include:
- Enable/disable logging
- Set log level threshold
- Enable email notifications for critical errors
- Set log retention period

## Log Format

```
[2024-01-15 10:30:45] [ERROR] [Capture] Failed to process video capture: File size exceeds limit
User: admin (ID: 1)
File: /includes/class-rmcu-capture-handler.php:145
Context: {"file_size": 104857600, "max_size": 52428800, "type": "video"}
```

## Troubleshooting

If logs are not being created:
1. Check directory permissions (should be 755 or 775)
2. Verify PHP has write access
3. Check available disk space
4. Ensure logging is enabled in settings

## Clean Up

To manually clean old logs:
```bash
# Remove logs older than 30 days
find . -name "*.log" -mtime +30 -delete

# Or use WP-CLI
wp rmcu logs clean --older-than=30
```

## Important Notes

- Never share log files publicly as they may contain sensitive information
- Regularly monitor error logs for issues
- Large log files can impact performance
- Consider using external logging services for production sites
